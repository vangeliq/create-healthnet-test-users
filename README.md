# create-healthnet-test-users

How to (hopefully) run it without any problems:
-  change the values for `inputFile`, `serverURL`, `realm`, `clientId` and `clientSecret`
-  The csv format is:
    - username,password,clientID,clientRealmName




NOTE: everyone who has access to the code can see the `clientSecret` value so be careful :)
